# Http api client to make requests to the server `Thor`

# Why move it to separate repo?
### 1) Less code in main repo
### 2) Easier to maintain and versioning
### 3) Easier to test
### 4) Modular and prepared if we create another repo 

# How to use it?

```
go get -u github.com/on-esports/thor
```
